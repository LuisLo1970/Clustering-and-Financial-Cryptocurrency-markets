# Clustering-and-Financial-Cryptocurrency-markets
Application for different partitional clustering techniques to analyze the cryptocurrency markets from different perspectives: financial and statistic.
Since the emergence of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies have grown significantly, not only in terms of capitalization but also in number. Consequently, the
cryptocurrency market can be a conducive arena for investors, as it offers many opportunities. However, it is difficult to understand. 
This project aims to describe, summarize, and segment the main trends of the entire cryptocurrency market in 2018, using data analysis tools. Accordingly, we
propose a new clustering-based methodology that provides complementary views of the financial behavior of cryptocurrencies, and one that looks for associations
between the clustering results, and other factors that are not involved in clustering. Particularly, the methodology involves applying three different 
partitional clustering algorithms, where each of them use a different representation for cryptocurrencies, namely, yearly mean, and standard deviation of the 
returns, distribution of returns that have not been applied to financial markets previously, and the time series of returns. Because each representation
provides a different outlook of the market, we also examine the integration of the three clustering results, to obtain a fine-grained analysis of the main
trends of the market. 

In conclusion, we analyze the association of the clustering results with other descriptive features of cryptocurrencies, including the age, technological
attributes, and financial ratios derived from them. This will help to enhance the profiling of the clusters with additional descriptive insights, and to find
associations with other variables. 
Consequently, this study describes the whole market based on graphical information, and a scalable methodology that can be reproduced by investors who want to
understand the main trends in the market quickly, and those that look for cryptocurrencies with different financial performance.In our analysis of the 2018 and
2019 for extended period, we found that the market can be typically segmented in few clusters (five or less), and even considering the intersections, the 6 more
populations account for 75\% of the market. Regarding the associations between the clusters and descriptive features, we find associations between some clusters
with volume, market capitalization, and some financial ratios, which could be explored in future research.
